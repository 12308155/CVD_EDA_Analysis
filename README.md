# CVD_EDA_Analysis
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the CAIR-CVD-2025 dataset using Python. Included data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing key patterns through histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps. Identified BMI and systolic blood pressure as major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
# 🩺 CVD Risk Factor EDA Project

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **CAIR-CVD-2025** dataset to identify major risk factors contributing to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). It uses Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical testing.

## 🔍 Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.  
2. **EDA & Visualization** – Used histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to explore patterns.  
3. **Statistical Testing** – Applied Z-test and T-test to validate significant variables.  
4. **Insights** – Found BMI and Systolic Blood Pressure as key CVD risk indicators.
